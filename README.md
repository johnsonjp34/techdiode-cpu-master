# techdiode-monero-cpu-master

Monero CPU miner forked from fireiceuk.

Default 1% goes to the developer. This can be changed by making your own build from the source.

#Setup

You will need to open the miner first. It will give you CPU information to paste into your configuration file in place of the "null" after CPU configuration.
