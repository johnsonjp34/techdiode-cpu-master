# techdiode-monero-cpu-master

Monero CPU miner forked from https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak-cpu.

Default 1% goes to the developer. This can be changed by making your own build from the source.

<b>Setup</b>

You will need to open the miner first. It will give you CPU information to paste into your configuration file in place of the "null" after CPU configuration.

<b> Anti Virus </b> 

As always you will need to add an exception to your antivirus or Windows Defender because Windows flags all crypto currency mining software.
